All my code changes were in Animation.cpp
I kept the display() function concise by making subfunctions (i.e. drawBee)


Requirements:
(a) You must use a hierarchical approach to model the complex objects. This applies both conceptually
(during your order of matrix transformations) and programmatically (breaking up your code into a hierarchy
of subroutines). (5 Points)
	DONE

(b) Model a static ground plane. (1 Point)
	DONE

(c) Model a tree that has a trunk made of 8 parts and a sphere for foliage. (2 Points)
	DONE

(d) The tree must visibly sway as shown by the sample executable. (2 Points)
	DONE

(e) Trunk parts rotate around the middle of the bottom face. (4 Points)
	DONE

(f) Animate the wings and legs of the wasp. You may use the same value for more than one
angle. The waspâ€™s main axis is X. All moving body parts must rotate around the Xaxis.
(5 Points)
	DONE

(g) The wasp flies in a circle around the vertical axis, and it should always be aligned with
the tangent of the circle. (3 Points)
	DONE

(h) The wasp must move up and down. (2 Points)
	DONE

(i) You need NOT match the exact motion or dimensions or colors of the sample code; however, your scene
must be qualitatively and visually similar to the one provided. You must rotate objects around the correct point
